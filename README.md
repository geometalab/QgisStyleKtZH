# QGIS Style

A Style for QGIS Layers. The goal is to recreate the design of the ground map of Canton Zürich. The layer definition file, also known as QLR, can be added to QGIS and applies to all layers. 

## Bodenkarte kt.Zh

Inspiration for the style was [canton Zürichs groundmap](https://maps.zh.ch/?scale=3050&srid=2056&topic=BASISKARTEZH&x=2684640.03&y=1274088.93) by a scale of 1:6200. There are multiple Styles for multiple Layers to recreate the map as good as possible. Some specific points cant be recreated since we have no fitting Data for them.
